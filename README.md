# Cocoa
### What is *Cocoa*?
* Cocoa is a game focused engine (will be latered repurposed as a toolkit).

* Cocoa uses C to squeeze as much performance as possible whilst
being simple to understand.

### Does this have any relevance to the Apple API by the same name?
* **This project was not named after Apple's proprietary api, it was named after my *frenchton***

### Why *C*?
At first I tried to understand game engine development through C++, 
and the obvious answer is that C++ is a super reliable choice for game development
due to its OOP paradigm and is the biggest choice for this reason. Despite this, I chose C over C++ mainly because of the extreme complexity compared to C
in my experience with it. Other than that, another reason that interested me is that C is **super** portable, and this allows me to use it anywhere which opens
up a lot of possibilites (using it in C#, Java, Python, etc).

### What will be provided?
* Vulkan for cross-platform rendering
* SDL3 for cross-platform window and input

As of right now *(November 18 2025)* it is very bare-bones so not much is
provided

### What would be added later/planned later?
* Multiple rendering apis (Offer native apis like DirectX and Metal)
* Support browsers (Provide WASM via emscripten and TypeScript glue?)
* Support VR (Provide many opportunities for the user to tinker with vr)
* Support mobile (Maybe?)
* Offer glue bindings in other languages (C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, etc..?)
* Provide editor? (Allow users to easily use features without having to develop programs in code by scratch with the engine)
* More to be thought of...
